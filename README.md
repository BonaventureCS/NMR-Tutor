NMR-Tutor
=========

Kyle Braham's indy study, Spring 2014. 

App Description: 

Discover the powerful tool of NMR by using H1 NMR, C13NMR and IR graphs to solve for the structure of an unknown molecule. 
The app will provide NMR chemical shift tables, sketch pad and table to keep track of your findings when solving for the unknown structure.  After all data is collected, your sketch table and pad will be available for user to console once drawing the final structure. This allows the solving process to be paper free. 

Help buttons will be available throughout the solving process for beginners but in no time those help buttons will be obsolete.
